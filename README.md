# Dancing-Beats
Advanced Graphics and Data Visualization Project (MS Course Project)

A bar analyzer that provides dynamic visual representation of songs based on their frequency data using Web Audio API in HTML5 and D3.js.
D3-based charts were created to compare different features of 100 songs such as beats (1 to 4) and structure (silence, instrumental, chorus, verse) which would benefit DJs and music composers.

##### Future Work:
This application supports visualization of external sound files, enabling this to easily become a plugin for other sites.
Convert 2D to 3D visualization .
